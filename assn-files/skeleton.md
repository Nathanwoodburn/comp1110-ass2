# Simple draft skeleton:


# Overview
## Board Setup
* Create a grid of tiles
* Create islands and assign size and location (on tiles)
* Create "stone circles" 
  


## On Game start functions
* Create player data (maybe using enums)
* Assign villages to players
* Assign settlers to players
* Randomly Assign resources and statuettes to map "stone circles" 

## Exploration Phase
1. Pick player
2. Player places piece (use function to check placement rules)
3. Repeat with next player (while not Exploration Phase over) 

## Check Placement
If piece is settler, check if one of:
* on unoccupied water
* on unoccupied land adjacent to one of their pieces

If piece is village, check on unoccupied land adjacent to one of their pieces

## Piece Placing
* Check placement (using function)
* Assign piece to tile
* If piece on "stone circle" > get resources and statuettes 

## Exploration Phase over
If one of:
* All resources (not including statuettes) have been collected
* No player has any remaining moves available





# Settlement Phase
## Setup
1. Remove pieces from board
2. Assign resources and statuettes to stone circles
3. Player after last player from exploration phase goes first
   
## Play
1. Pick player (from setup.3)
2. Player places piece (use settlement check function to check placement rules)
3. Repeat with next player (while not Exploration Phase over) 

## End
Use same conditions as exploration phase over
Score


# Scoring

## Island Scoring
* If player has pieces on > 7 islands, score 20 points
* If player has pieces on 7 islands, score 10 points
* Otherwise, score 0 points

## Links Scoring
1. For each player get largest link
2. Score 5 points per island in largest link

## Majorities Scoring
* Player with most pieces on each island type scores points assigned to that island
* Ties are distributed evenly rounding down

## Resources Scoring
* For each player
  * For each resource
    * If >3 of resource, score 20 points
    * If 3 of resource, score 10 points
    * If 2 of resource, score 5 points
  * If player has all 4 resources, score 10 points

## Statuettes Scoring
* Each statuette is worth 4 points

## General comments
Well done on completing all the tasks for D2C, your submission is quite impressive! Here are a few general comments:

- It would be good to use your classes (outside of BlueLagoon, Viewer and eventually Game) and object-oriented programming to pass the tasks and set up the framework for your game, as strings are inefficient and will be hard to use when making your game.
- You should try to ensure that your code does not go past the vertical line in IntelliJ, by putting in line breaks if possible.
- Your Git usage as a group are excellent - your commits are frequent and have detailed messages!
- In some parts IntelliJ has highlighted your code (such as lines 243 and 335 of BlueLagoon.java) - in these parts you can hover over these for suggestions which may improve the readability or style of your code.
- Your commenting throughout your code is excellent!
- In your final game (and viewer to a lesser extent), it would be good to make the islands different colours based on how many points they award.

## Task 5 (Viewer)

Your viewer is quite intuitive, though it doesn't seem to differentiate between the settlers/villagers of different players. I'm also not able to click the Refresh button more than once, though I'm not sure what's causing this.
